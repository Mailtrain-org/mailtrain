# This file is the default config file for Mailtrain. To use a environment specific
# configuration add new file {ENV}.{ext} (eg. "production.toml") to the same folder.
# {ENV} is defined by NODE_ENV environment variable.
#
# Do not modify this file directly, otherwise you might lose your modifications when upgrading
#
# You should only define the options you want to change in your additional config file.
# For example if the only thing you want to change is the port number for the www server
# then your additional config file should look like this:
#   # production.toml
#   [www]
#   port=80
# or if you want to use Javascript instead of TOML then the same file could look like this:
#   // production.js
#   module.exports = {
#       www: {
#           port: 80
#       }
#   };

# then you can downgrade the user once all services are up and running
