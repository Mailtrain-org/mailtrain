# This file is the default config file for Mailtrain. To use a environment specific
# configuration add new file {ENV}.{ext} (eg. "production.toml") to the same folder.
# {ENV} is defined by NODE_ENV environment variable.
#
# Do not modify this file directly, otherwise you might lose your modifications when upgrading
#
# You should only define the options you want to change in your additional config file.
# For example if the only thing you want to change is the port number for the www server
# then your additional config file should look like this:
#   # production.toml
#   [www]
#   port=80
# or if you want to use Javascript instead of TOML then the same file could look like this:
#   // production.js
#   module.exports = {
#       www: {
#           port: 80
#       }
#   };

[reports]
# The whole reporting functionality can be disabled below if the they are not needed and the DB cannot be
# properly protected.
# Reports rely on custom user defined Javascript snippets defined in the report template. The snippets are run on the
# server when generating a report. As these snippets are stored in the DB, they pose a security risk because they can
# help gaining access to the server if the DB cannot
# be properly protected (e.g. if it is shared with another application with security weaknesses).
# Mailtrain mitigates this problem by running the custom Javascript snippets in a chrooted environment and under a
# DB user that cannot modify the database (see userRO in [mysql] above). However the chrooted environment is available
# only if Mailtrain is started as root. The chrooted environment still does not prevent the custom JS script in
# performing network operations and in generating XSS attacks as part of the report.
# The bottom line is that if people who are creating report templates or have write access to the DB cannot be trusted,
# then it's safer to switch off the reporting functionality below.
